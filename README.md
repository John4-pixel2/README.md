## About Me

I'm John from Germany 🇩🇪. My journey in tech started with a fascination for solving problems and finding ways to make life simpler — whether through technology or creative solutions. My passion for **Copywriting** complements my technical learning, as I believe that clear, persuasive communication is key to every successful project. I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and hands-on with the latest tools, especially in the world of **AWS Cloud** and **Docker**.

I enjoy the challenge of streamlining processes, making tech accessible, and creating impactful content that resonates with people. Whether it's through writing or coding, my goal is to build solutions that work.

## New to Tech

As someone relatively new to tech, I’m on an exciting learning journey. The world of **Cloud Engineering** is vast, and I'm thrilled to dive deep into it. The hands-on approach is the best way for me to learn—I believe that the best way to understand a tool or technology is by using it to build real projects.

Learning new skills is a key part of my approach, and I’m constantly motivated by the challenge of learning and implementing the most effective solutions. Whether it’s coding, cloud infrastructure, or learning new tools, I’m eager to keep growing and improving. The process is as important as the result!

## Side Hustle: Copywriting

While my main focus is Cloud Engineering, I’ve also cultivated a **side hustle** in **copywriting**. I help businesses and individuals communicate effectively, crafting content that speaks to the heart of the message. Whether it's web content, blogs, or product descriptions, I focus on clarity, engagement, and delivering value through words.

Tech and creativity go hand in hand for me—copywriting helps me communicate complex topics simply, and my tech skills empower me to build and optimize solutions that align with business goals. I believe this combination of skills can lead to innovative projects and outstanding results.

## Learning Goals

I’m deeply committed to **hands-on learning** and setting clear goals for my journey. Some of my current learning objectives include:

- Mastering **AWS Cloud** architecture and services
- Deepening my knowledge of **Docker** and containerization
- Gaining fluency in **Python** and **Flask** for backend development
- Developing an understanding of **databases** (SQL/NoSQL)
- Exploring the world of **APIs** and how they connect systems
- Improving my **copywriting** and communication skills for tech
